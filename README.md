**PPIG 2017 - 28th Annual Workshop**

1 Jul 2017 to 3 Jul 2017<br />
Delft, Netherlands

The Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG) will meet from the 1st to 3rd of July 2017, in Deflt, the Netherlands. This year we’ll be proximately-located with Joy of Coding, meeting at The Science Centre, we hope you’ll join us there.

**Call for Papers**<br />
In 2017 we’re especially interested in the psychology of programming as a form of artistic expression. We encourage authors to look beyond the traditional stomping grounds of programming and consider other domains.

PPIG has a tradition of breadth. Our previous discussion ranged from CS education topics to software engineering, programming music, robots and collaboration. The philosophy of computation, visual programming languages and programming language design are all in scope.

We have open minds, and enjoy conversations around creative and risky ideas more than polished 'correctness'. If you think we might be interested, give us a try.

We will welcome the following categories of submissions:

Full Papers: Up to 10 pages long.<br />
Work In Progress reports: Up to 4 pages long.<br />
System demonstrations and reflections: an abstract, video, or artwork outlining what you will present. Crashes are desirable. Up to 2.5 days long.<br />
Doctoral consortium submissions: Up to 2 pages long.<br />
Please use our templates for papers.

Submissions are due as follows:

Abstract submission deadline: 15th of April, 2017<br />
Paper submission deadline: 1st of May, 2017<br />
Doctoral consortium submissions deadline: 1st of May, 2017<br />
Limited funding may be available to support travel for doctoral consortium submissions. Please get in touch for details.
