\begin{abstract}

Programming is inherently a problem-solving exercise: A programmer has to create an understanding of the situation, externalize and contextualize thoughts \& ideas, develop strategies on how to proceed with the task, enact changes according to the most appropriate strategy, and reflect to learn from each problem.
Therefore, programming is clearly more than just code input, testing, and maintenance.
Current Integrated Development Environments (IDE), however, largely focus on the "writing code" parts of programming.
In this paper, we revisit which activities and actions constitute programming, and highlight six challenges to supporting these activities. 
We then briefly describe a new paradigm of interacting with the IDE that we are working on to more directly support each of the six activities.
